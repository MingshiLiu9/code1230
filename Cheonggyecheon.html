Temperatures along the stream is 3.3 to 5.9 degrees cooler than on a parallel road 4-7 blocks away. Because of the removal of the paved expressway, the cooling effect of the stream, the cooling effect of the stream, increased vegetation, reduction In auto trips, a 2.2-7.8% increase in wind speeds move through the corridor.<br><br>

<p>d) Reduced small-particle air pollution
Small-particle air pollution is reduced by 35% from 74 to 48 micrograms per cubic meter. The possibility  of respiratory disease of the residents in this area is more than twice in other parts of the city. (CABE 2011)<br><br>
